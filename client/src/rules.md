# Rules for Organizing Code in the `src` Folder

To maintain a clean and organized codebase, it is important to establish some rules for organizing code within the `src` folder. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1. **Components**: Create a separate folder for each component. Place all related files (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, tests) for a component within its respective folder.

2. **Subfolders**: If a component has multiple subcomponents or related files, create subfolders within the component folder to further organize the code.

3. **Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful and descriptive names for both folders and files. Follow a consistent naming convention, such as PascalCase for folders and camelCase for files.

4. **Index Files**: Consider adding an `index.js` file in each component folder to serve as the entry point for that component. This can help simplify imports and improve code readability.

5. **Shared Code**: If there are common utilities, constants, or styles that are used across multiple components, create a separate `shared` folder to store such code. This promotes code reuse and avoids duplication.

6. **Routing**: If your project involves routing, consider creating a separate folder for routing-related files. This can include route configurations, route components, and any other routing-specific code.

7. **Tests**: Place all unit tests or integration tests for a component within a `__tests__` folder inside the component folder. This keeps the tests closely associated with the code they are testing.

Remember, these rules are just guidelines, and you can adapt them to fit the specific needs of your project. The key is to maintain consistency and organization throughout your codebase.
